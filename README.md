## 🔧 What Is a RESTful API?
REST (Representational State Transfer) is an architectural style for building APIs.
A RESTful API uses standard HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) to allow communication between a client (like a frontend app) and a server (your Node.js backend).


## 🧱 Tech Stack
Node.js – A JavaScript runtime that lets you run JS code on the server.
Express.js – A lightweight Node.js framework that simplifies building web servers and APIs.

# 🌐 HTTP Methods in RESTful API

## ✅ 1. GET – Retrieve Data
Purpose: Fetch data from the server.
Safe: It doesn’t change anything on the server.
Idempotent: Multiple identical GET requests have the same effect.
Example Use: Viewing a list of users or retrieving details of a specific product.
🧠 Think of it as: "Just show me the data."

## ✅ 2. POST – Create New Data
Purpose: Submit new data to the server.
Not Idempotent: Submitting the same data multiple times may create multiple records.
Example Use: Registering a new user or submitting a contact form.
🧠 Think of it as: "Here is some new data, please store it."


## ✅ 3. PUT – Replace Existing Data
Purpose: Completely replace a resource with new data.
Idempotent: Sending the same PUT request repeatedly results in the same state.
Requires Full Data: Even unchanged fields must be included.
Example Use: Updating all details of a user account.
🧠 Think of it as: "Replace the entire record with this new version."


## ✅ 4. PATCH – Update Partial Data
Purpose: Modify part of an existing resource.
Partially Idempotent: Usually safe to repeat, depending on implementation.
Example Use: Changing just a user’s email or status without touching other data.
🧠 Think of it as: "Change only this piece of data."


## ✅ 5. DELETE – Remove Data
Purpose: Permanently delete a resource.
Idempotent: Deleting the same resource multiple times has the same effect.
Example Use: Removing a user or deleting a comment.
🧠 Think of it as: "Remove this item from the system."


## 🧠 What is Middleware?
In Express, middleware is a function that runs before the final route handler. It can inspect, modify, or reject requests based on logic like:
Authentication
Logging
Validation ✅
Error handling


## 🎯 Why Use Middleware for Validation?
When a client sends data via POST or PUT to your API, you want to:
Check if required fields are present
Ensure data is in the correct format (e.g., string, number, email)
Reject incomplete or invalid requests before reaching your controller logic
🧠 Think of it as a gatekeeper — it checks the incoming data before it enters your application's logic.

## ✅ For POST (Create New Resource)
Validate that name, email, password are all present
Check that email is in valid format
Ensure password meets strength requirements


## ✅ For PUT (Update Resource)
Validate required fields (depending on app logic)
Possibly allow optional fields, but check their format if provided
