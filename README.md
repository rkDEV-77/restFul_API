## 🔧 What Is a RESTful API?
REST (Representational State Transfer) is an architectural style for building APIs.
A RESTful API uses standard HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) to allow communication between a client (like a frontend app) and a server (your Node.js backend).


## 🧱 Tech Stack
Node.js – A JavaScript runtime that lets you run JS code on the server.
Express.js – A lightweight Node.js framework that simplifies building web servers and APIs.

# 🌐 HTTP Methods in RESTful API

## ✅ 1. GET – Retrieve Data
Purpose: Fetch data from the server.
Safe: It doesn’t change anything on the server.
Idempotent: Multiple identical GET requests have the same effect.
Example Use: Viewing a list of users or retrieving details of a specific product.
🧠 Think of it as: "Just show me the data."

## ✅ 2. POST – Create New Data
Purpose: Submit new data to the server.
Not Idempotent: Submitting the same data multiple times may create multiple records.
Example Use: Registering a new user or submitting a contact form.
🧠 Think of it as: "Here is some new data, please store it."


## ✅ 3. PUT – Replace Existing Data
Purpose: Completely replace a resource with new data.
Idempotent: Sending the same PUT request repeatedly results in the same state.
Requires Full Data: Even unchanged fields must be included.
Example Use: Updating all details of a user account.
🧠 Think of it as: "Replace the entire record with this new version."


## ✅ 4. PATCH – Update Partial Data
Purpose: Modify part of an existing resource.
Partially Idempotent: Usually safe to repeat, depending on implementation.
Example Use: Changing just a user’s email or status without touching other data.
🧠 Think of it as: "Change only this piece of data."


## ✅ 5. DELETE – Remove Data
Purpose: Permanently delete a resource.
Idempotent: Deleting the same resource multiple times has the same effect.
Example Use: Removing a user or deleting a comment.
🧠 Think of it as: "Remove this item from the system."


## 🧠 What is Middleware?
In Express, middleware is a function that runs before the final route handler. It can inspect, modify, or reject requests based on logic like:
Authentication
Logging
Validation ✅
Error handling


## 🎯 Why Use Middleware for Validation?
When a client sends data via POST or PUT to your API, you want to:
Check if required fields are present
Ensure data is in the correct format (e.g., string, number, email)
Reject incomplete or invalid requests before reaching your controller logic
🧠 Think of it as a gatekeeper — it checks the incoming data before it enters your application's logic.

## ✅ For POST (Create New Resource)
Validate that name, email, password are all present
Check that email is in valid format
Ensure password meets strength requirements


## ✅ For PUT (Update Resource)
Validate required fields (depending on app logic)
Possibly allow optional fields, but check their format if provided



# WORKING

## 1. Client Sends an HTTP Request
The client can be a frontend app, mobile app, or any HTTP client like Postman.

It sends a request to your server’s endpoint (URL).

The request includes:

HTTP method (GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE)

URL (resource path, e.g., /users/5)

Optional headers (authentication tokens, content-type)

Optional body (data sent for POST/PUT/PATCH)



## 2. Express Server Receives the Request
Your Node.js app runs an Express server that listens on a specific port (e.g., 3000).

Express waits for incoming HTTP requests.



## 3. Routing: Matching Request to Route
Express compares the request URL and HTTP method against the routes you've defined.

For example, a GET /users/5 request will match a route like:

app.get('/users/:id', handlerFunction);
The :id is a route parameter extracted from the URL (5 in this case).



## 4. Middleware Processing
Before the route handler executes, middleware functions can process the request.

Common middleware tasks:

Parsing JSON bodies (express.json())

Logging requests

Checking authentication tokens

Validating input data

Middleware acts like a pipeline: each middleware calls next() to pass control to the next middleware or to the route handler.

## 5. Controller (Route Handler) Executes Logic
The route handler (also called controller) contains the logic to:

Extract data from the request (params, query, body).

Perform business logic (e.g., fetch data, update database).

Interact with the database or other services.

Prepare a response.

Example for GET /users/:id:

Extract id from req.params.

Fetch the user record from the database.

If found, return user data.

If not found, return 404 error.



## 6. Send Response
The server sends a response back to the client.

Response contains:

Status code (e.g., 200 OK, 201 Created, 404 Not Found)

Headers (like Content-Type: application/json)

Body (usually JSON data representing the resource or error info)



## 7. Client Receives and Processes the Response
The client reads the response.

Based on the response status and data, the client updates UI or handles errors.
